1,Dolce&Gabbana,"Dolce&Gabanna is an Italian luxury fashion house founded in 1985 by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. Making an immediate impact with their flashy, sexy clothing—for example, their signature ""corset dresses""—and provocative advertising, the house quickly gained fame and the loyalty of high-profile celebrity customers such as Madonna, who wears their fashions offstage and has hired the house to design costumes for her performances. Dolce&Gabbana offers clothing under two brands: Dolce&Gabbana (officially spelled with no spaces), which focuses on luxury clothing, eyewear, accessories and perfumes; and D&G, a more casual and contemporary line of clothing, watches and fragrances. Both lines utilize the recognizable ""D&G"" logo on many of their products."
2,Jo Malone London,"Jo Malone is a UK-based fragrance designer who got her start in the fragrance industry as a florist. Her lifelong fondness for all things fragrant began as a child, when she tried to produce her own fragrances using flowers from the family garden and grated soap. Working as a florist by day and a beautician who did facials by night, her business took off when the Nutmeg and Ginger bath oil she produced as a thank-you gift for clients led to requests for re-orders. In 1994, Jo Malone opened her first boutique in London, offering fragrances, skin care, and home scents. A flagship boutique on London's famed Sloane Street was opened in 1999."
3,Viktor&Rolf,"Viktor & Rolf is an Amsterdam-based fashion house. The ""Viktor & Rolf"" of the house's name are Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren. Both Viktor and Rolf were born in 1969, and met when they studied fashion at the Academy of the Arts at Arnhem. The pair bear a slight physical resemblance to each other and are known for being photographed or strutting down the catwalk after the fashion shows in identical outfits. Such spectacles are also present in their fashion shows, which take the form of artistic presentations and which have featured such interesting sights as a single model being dressed in nine different layers of couture gowns, fashion shows that featured models wearing blue clothing that served as a ""blue screen"" for film projections, and shows in which each model wore her own scaffolding with her own lights and music. For their first menswear collection, ""Monsieur,"" Viktor and Rolf modeled the clothing themselves, changing outfits onstage in front of the press and guests."
4,Mugler,"Thierry Mugler is a French fashion designer and photographer known for his 1980s power fashions and widely credited with introducing a new fragrance trend or category—gourmand—in the 1990s. Mugler originally trained as a dancer and worked professionally starting at age 14. After studying interior design, he moved to Paris at age 24 and began working as a window dresser and freelance designer. His first personal collection for women was produced in 1973. Mugler opened his first Paris boutique and also launched a menswear collection in 1978. His style is distinguished by its futuristic shapes and fantasy elements. Mugler's first fragrance, Angel, was introduced in 1992 and set the fragrance world on fire with its unabashed sweet and foodie notes. Hugely influential on the perfume industry of the 1990s, with influences extending into the 21st century, Angel continues to be a best-seller with both women and men, and was inducted into the Fifi Awards Hall of Fame in 2007."
5,Tom Ford,"Thomas Carlyle Ford, better known today as Tom Ford, is an American fashion designer and film director. Initially trained as an architect at Parsons School of Design, Ford spent a year working abroad at an internship for fashion house Chlo? and developed a feel for the fashion industry. Ford concealed his architecture background and displayed considerable personal charm in his pursuit of a job in the fashion industry. His first position was with American designer Cathy Hardwick. He accepted a position with Perry Ellis, but knew better prospects were available in Europe. Prestigious Italian fashion house Gucci was struggling at the time, and Ford accepted a position in Gucci's women's Ready-to-Wear division in 1990. Ford achieved considerable success at Gucci, eventually heading up multiple divisions before being named Creative Director in 1992. Ford's efforts were pivotal in Gucci's turn-around. The company was nearly bankrupt when Ford joined the organization, but when he left in 2004, the company's value had more than doubled. During Ford's tenure with Gucci, the company acquired Yves Saint Laurent, and Ford created provocative, controversial and highly successful ad campagins for YSL fragrances Opium and M7. These ads were an early indicator of Ford's future direction."

In contract to the stiff, formal, made-to-measure clothing offered by couture designers of the 1950s, Chloe chose to create soft, wearable, form-fitting clothing of luxurious fabrics, intended to be purchased ""off the rack."" This was a revolutionary and trend-setting concept in fashion at the time, as well as a long-lasting motif in the fashion industry."
